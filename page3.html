            <p>Q: Yitong, where do all your internet handles come from?</p>
            <p class=ans>A: NitroNuke comes from a dumb joke I made as part of a project when I was maybe 7 years old which happened to stick. Natani was the name of the first character I played in Dungeons and Dragons, which I picked because the name sounded androgynous so it could easily be reused. Tyogin is the handle I picked up most recently to make myself look presentable to the internet. It's just an anagram of my first name.</p>
            <p>Q: What's with your crazy bleached hair?</p>
            <p class=ans>A: In high school I was struggling to manage time and had to drop out of extracurriculars to study and work, but I still wanted something unique to define myself. I picked hair. I still think it was a good call. Got it done at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidshairlondon/"target=_blank>David's Hair Design</a>, check it out if you're in London.</p>
            <p>Q: Were your parents cool with it?</p>
            <p class=ans>A: I told them in advance that I was going to do it, and they thought I was joking. They were not happy for a little bit when they realized I followed through. After a while they got used to it though.</p>
            <p>Q: Was journalism your first choice?</p>
            <p class=ans>A: Third, actually. I wanted to pursue music through most of high school. By the end it turned out I had neither the talent or skill to follow through on it as a career. After that I considered an English degree, but realized analyzing every piece of literature wasn't for me. Journalism ended up being a nice blend of creativity and writing for me, where I could also make use of the auditory skills I picked up through music.</p>
            <p>Q: What do you hope to do after your degree?</p>
            <p class=ans>A: I'd really just love to find a nice peaceful desk job somewhere. If I do somehow find myself in the field of jounalism even remotely though, I'd like to work with audio. Radio or podcasts would both be fields that interest me.</p>
            <p>Q: Do you have any useful skills outside of school material?</p>
              <p class=ans>A: I took a first aid and AED course once</p>

            <p>Q: Are you single?</p>
              <p class=ans>A: Yes and accepting <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpzF4BoTDzKELjsCJvBTO3U9nkNJlSNm8XZgh4rLpprQKGnA/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">applications</a> to fill the position. No prior work experience required.</p>
