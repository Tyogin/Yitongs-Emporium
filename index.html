            <h1>Who Am I and Where are You?</h1>
            <p>Welcome dear wanderer, to Wonderland. It's a pleasure, and while I'd like to introduce myself but I'm not sure which self to introduce just yet. Perhaps, that comes across as a bit disingenuous, so please allow me to explain myself. I'm a player, one who changes masks, and here is where I've set up shop for you to peruse my handiwork. Whatever name you may know me by, it's lost upon us down in Wonderland as I go by many names while I'm here. Perhaps you're here looking one of my masks, and have a chat, or perhaps you're just browsing, but take a look and maybe you'll find something you like.</p>
            <p>A look at my wares:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6111127/osu" target="_blank">"Tyogin"</a>
            <p>A fine part of the collection. I keep this one well polished, yet it never seems to shine quite as brightly as I had hoped, though perhaps in time it will achieve the lustre I've sought.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://app.roll20.net/users/402171/natani" target="_blank">"Natani"</a>
            <p>This one here's an old thorn in my side, but one I can't bear the thought of throwing away. I'm not sure though if it's because or in spite of how long it's been with me.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://go.twitch.tv/nitronuke">"NitroNuke"</a>
            <p>There's refinement yet to be made to this one. The barebones are there, but it's lacking everywhere else. At the moment it's more of a frame than anything else.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Mask of Tyogin</h2>
            <p>She wears a mask filled with drive, a desire to improve. This desire tragically is held back by the ability to perform, as her tempo, precision, movement and flexibility are all put to the test. Though she stumbles in her progress, when pushed far enough she makes a brilliant breakthrough from time to time. Aspriations without substance are a meager thing, but Tyogin always manages to put on a show just as the crowd is about to die down.</p>

            <h2>The Mask of Natani</h2>
            <p>Natani fancies himself a bit of a player as well. The brat thinks himself capable of such things as discretion and finesse. Through the years he's carved many masks of his own, though frankly they're more than a bit rough around the edges. Currently he's playing the part of a Triad, a mobster from a foreign land, set in a time ahead of ours. He acts these out as adventures along with others, but keeps few records from the past.</p>

            <h2>The Mask of NitroNuke</h2>
            <p>The beginnings of a creator's visage are in place here, but that's all it is - a beginning. Not much work has been done on fleshing it out, but one day I would like to see this one resemble my own face. If it can recreate or represent what I am most interested in at any given time I would consider the work a success.</p>
