              <h2>Occupation</h2>
            <p>The various handles I go by online or in certain groups aside, my name is Yitong Zhao and I'm a student at uOttawa. My current field of study is digital journalism, and I am in my second year of this program. Before moving to Ottawa to pursue my post-secondary school career, I grew up in London Ontario and graduated from high school at London Central Secondary School.</p>
              <h2>Upbringing</h2>
            <p>My family and I have been living in Canada for over 17 years now. Although I was born in Shanghai China, Canada is my home and always will be. Over the course of those 17 years, I've learned what it means to be a contributing member of this country. Although so much of our identity as Canadians has to do with our acceptance of others as a people, I will never underestimate the cultural value of Tim Hortons. After working at Timmies for close to two years, it's impossible to forget the devotion some customers have to our national brand.</p>
              <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>Outside of school and work, I have huge interests in roleplaying and videogames. I have a regular Dungeons and Dragons group, and am currently signing up for a Shadowrun group through reddit. As far as games go I prefer online PC gaming, and typically am playing whatever is "in season". Lately it's been Warframe, and before that Path of Exile, but when all else fails I always fall back to "osu!". Asides from that I also have a sizeable Steam library to keep me busy.</p>
            <p>Find out more about some of my hobbies:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>As for a few of the other things I like, less along the hobby line of things, I'm a big fan of Kpop music, I'm interested in amateur dance. I've even gotten involved myself before as you can see below!</p>
